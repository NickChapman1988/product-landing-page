# Product Landing Page

![Image]()

This mini project was made as part of the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/) Responsive Web Design certification course. 

The brief was to build a [CodePen.io](codepen.io) Product Landing Page app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/RKRbwL.

This project was based on products by [The Army Painter](https://www.thearmypainter.com/), for whom I am an official retailer through my own online store [The Sleeping Dragon Hobby Shop](https://www.sleepingdragonhobbyshop.co.uk/). 

My original CodePen can be viewed [here](https://codepen.io/nickchapman1988/pen/zYRGdxZ)

As part of the project brief, several user stories were specified to be met. These were as follows:

<table>
    <tr>
    <th>STORY ID</th>
    <th>USER STORY</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>User Story #1:</td>
    <td>My product landing page should have a header element with a corresponding id="header".</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>User Story #2:</td>
    <td> I can see an image within the header element with a corresponding id="header-img". A company logo would make a good image here.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>User Story #3:</td>
    <td>Within the #header element I can see a nav element with a corresponding id="nav-bar".</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>User Story #4:</td>
    <td>I can see at least three clickable elements inside the nav element, each with the class nav-link.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>User Story #5:</td>
    <td>When I click a .nav-link button in the nav element, I am taken to the corresponding section of the landing page.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>User Story #6:</td>
    <td>I can watch an embedded product video with id="video".</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>User Story #7:</td>
    <td>My landing page has a form element with a corresponding id="form".</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>User Story #8:</td>
    <td>Within the form, there is an input field with id="email" where I can enter an email address.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>User Story #9:</td>
    <td>The #email input field should have placeholder text to let the user know what the field is for.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>User Story #10:</td>
    <td>The #email input field uses HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered text is an email address.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>User Story #11:</td>
    <td>Within the form, there is a submit input with a corresponding id="submit".</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>User Story #12:</td>
    <td>When I click the #submit element, the email is submitted to a static page (use this mock URL: https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>User Story #13:</td>
    <td>The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>User Story #14:</td>
    <td>My product landing page should have at least one media query.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>User Story #15:</td>
    <td>My product landing page should utilize CSS flexbox at least once.</td>
    </tr>
</table>
